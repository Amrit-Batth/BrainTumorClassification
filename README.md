**Brain Tumor Classification Project**

1.Description:
  This project implements a deep learning model for classifying brain tumor images into different categories based on MRI scans.

2.Installation:
  Clone this repository:
  bash
  Copy code:
  git clone https://github.com/Amrit-Batth/Brain-Tumor-Classification.git
3.Extract zip file 

4. Model Training:
  The deep learning model is based on a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture. It is trained using the SGD optimizer with a 
  categorical cross-entropy loss function.

5.Evaluation:
  The model achieves an accuracy of over 90% on the test dataset.

6.Results:
  Accuracy: 85%
  Precision: 80%
  F1-score: 83%
  
7.Future Work:
  Explore techniques for improving model performance.
  Extend the project to classify different types of brain tumors.
